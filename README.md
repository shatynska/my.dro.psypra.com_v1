### Laravel Inertia React w/ Typescript

By default, if we use package like Laravel breeze, it'll use regular javascript react by default. But this project is for you who want to use inertia.js with typescript boilerplate.

This project has come with some features like:
- Authentication
- User Profile
- User Avatar
- User Password
- User Delete

### The default branch has been renamed!

**9.x** is now named **laravel-9.x**

If you have a local clone, you can update it by running the following commands.

```bash
git branch -m 9.x laravel-9.x
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/laravel-9.x laravel-9.x
git remote set-head origin -a
```

### About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling.

### About Inertia.js

Inertia.js lets you quickly build modern single-page React, Vue and Svelte apps using classic server-side routing and controllers.

### About Typescript

Typescript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

### Available scripts

Feel free to use someting like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/). It just node package manager I have, so make yours.

```bash
# Format with prettier
npm run format

# Start development
npm run dev

# Build the app
npm run dev

# Testing for SSR
npm run test-ssr
```

### Components
This project has a few helpers available to you. You can use them in your components like this:

#### useRoute()
Gives you access to a typed version of [ziggy-js's](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) route() function.

```tsx
import useRoute from '@/hooks/useRoute';

export default function SomeComponent() {
  const route = useRoute();

  return <a href={route('profile.edit')}>Edit profile</a>;
}
```

#### useTypedPage()
Gives you access to a typed version of usePage() from inertia.js
```tsx
import useTypedPage from '@/hooks/useTypedPage';
export default function SomeComponent() {
    const { props } = useTypedPage<{ canViewThisPage: boolean; }>();
    const { canViewThisPage, user } = props;
}
```
### Update profile information
Of course it is not just about authentication, but also about updating user profile information, password, and deleting account.
